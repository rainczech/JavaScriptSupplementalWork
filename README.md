# JavaScriptSupplementalWork

##Requirements
* JavaScript or JQuery providing a fetch or ajax call
* creating your own giphy api key and utilizing it
* data- attributes; gif will populate in the still state, animate upon click, and pause when clicked again
* there will be an area where the user can type their own animal/word, and a button will appear with the users word. So dynamically created button.
* upon click of the user's word, 6 (arbitary number I chose just now) will appear. So dynamically created gif's.
* have the rating of the gif appear below the gif

BONUS
* exclude rated gifs higher than PG-13
